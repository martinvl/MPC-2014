Albert is living on the number line in his hometown at the origo.
One day he decides to go visit his friend Isaac who lives far far away in another town on the positive side of the line.
Since the distance is so long, and the fuel tank on Albert's car is quite small, 
he is relying on buying more gas in the towns he visits on his way to Isaac.
Each town has exactly one gas station, with a given gas price.
The distance between some neighbour cities are quite big, 
so Albert is worried that he may not be able to get to  Isaac's town at all.
And if he is able to get there, what will it cost?

Albert starts from his hometown at x = 0 with an empty fuel tank.
At each town he may buy as much fuel as he wants to, but he may not exceed the volume in the fuel tank. 
The car spends exactly one liter of gas per length unit.

Input:
The input start with one integer 0 =< L <= 50, the volume of the fuel tank on Albert's car.
Then follows an integer 2 =< N <= 1000, the number of towns between Albert's town and Isaac's town.
Both Albert's town and Isaac's town are included.
Finally follows N lines (one line for each town), with two integers.
The first integer represents the position of the town on the number line, 
and the second integer represents the price per liter of gas in that town.
The towns will be sorted by increasing position, and Isaac always lives in the Nth town. No two towns lie at the same point.

Output:
If it is not possible to reach the final city, output "Stay home".
If it is possible to reach the final city, output the least amount of money Albert needs to spend.
