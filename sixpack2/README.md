#Sixpack shopper 2
(See Sixpack shopper for full description)
It turns out Greg gets a lot of new friends by buying everybody beer, so he needs even more help finding out if there will be a fight.

The situation is exactly the same as before, but this time he's got _really_ many friends.

## Input
Input consists of a single line with a single integer _f_, the number of friends Greg wants to buy beer to.
