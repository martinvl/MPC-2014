Tomorrow is election day at MAPS and the time has come to choose a new leader for the organization.
But how to pick a leader when every reasonable person would wish to be the new leader himself?
For of course, in such a case, every candidate would simply vote for himself.

Yang (the mathematician) suggests an easy process to pick the new leader:
the $N$ candidates will place themselves at positions 1 through $N$ on a circle,
and then every second person (starting at the second position)
will consecutively be eliminated until there is only one candidate left.

For example, if $N=5$ the candidates at position
2, 4
will be the first to be eliminated. Then those as positions
1, 3
follow, so the person position at 5 becomes the next leader.



Yang knows all MAPPERS to be reasonable, but he is not sure how many persons will present themselves at the election.

Given a list of $T$ possible number of candidates $N$, can you help Yang calculate a table telling him where to position himself for each $N$?


Input:
The first line of the input gives the number $T$ of entries in the table.
$T$ entries follow, one for each line.
Each entry consists of the possible number $N$ of candidates to participate in the election.

1<= T <= 400

Small input:
1<= N <= 10^5

Large input:
1<= N <= 10^15


Output:
For each entry $N$ in the table output the position $1<=i<=N$ where Yang would place himself.
