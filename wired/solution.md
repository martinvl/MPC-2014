# Wired
Must be able to check parallellism and orthogonalism without error, so integer arithmetics is required.

Since parallellism and orthogonalism are equivalence classes it suffices to check that all wires are either parallell or orthogonal to (for instance) the first wire.

Must have overall complexity less than O(n<sup>2</sup>), should have O(n) but O(n log n) might work.
