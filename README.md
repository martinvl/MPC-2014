These are the exercices for the first competition fully organized by MAPS!

### Online judge
Martin has set up an online judge (similar to the one we will use during the contest). This is good place to test alternative solutions and timing. Only the problems with testcases have been added.

First download the fake [SSL certificate](http://95.85.46.235/domjudge/public.crt) we are using, and [add it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=add+certificate+firefox&l=1) to your browser.

Then [log in](http://95.85.46.235/domjudge/team) to test your solutions.

The following users are registered, they all have the password `z8zsri`.
