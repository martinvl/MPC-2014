# The Exponentialist
Michael is a huge fan of movies and recently he has watched Rain Man one too
many times. Michael wants to convince his friends that he is also an
authistic savant and a human calculator. He has claimed that he has mad skills
at doing modular exponentiation. Michael knows more about goat anotomy than
he knows about modular exponentiation, so he needs your help.

You are given a base number _a_ and an exponent _b_. Your task is to compute
a<sup>b</sup> (mod n).

# Constraints
2 &le; _a_,_b_ &le; 10<sup>9</sup> <br />
100 &le; _n_ &le; 1000

# Input
One line consisting of three integers _a_, _b_ and _n_.

# Output
Output a<sup>b</sup> (mod n).

## Sample input
```
2 3 5
```
## Sample output
```
3
