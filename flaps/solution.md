Implement definite integral either by analytical solution (expressed through the gamma function), or by numerical integration. For instance trapezoidal, midpoint or quadratic integration will work, but must achieve sufficient precision.

Numerical integration is probably the easiest most straight-forward solution. Analytical solution via Wolfram alpha has a few pitfalls due to the parametrization used in SciPy.

Time shouldn't be an issue on this problem, but number of iterations in numerical solutions must of course be reasonable.
